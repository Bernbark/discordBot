# discordBot

This is my attempt at a Classy bot, aka a bot in Discord.py using Classes and subclassing.

It's a neat bot. I learned about discord UI components. I was hoping Modal would work with Button but it doesn't (yet?)

Currently you can save shows/movies to watch later, scout, steal from, and fight your friends, explore an endless wasteland, and play minigames.

I guess you can also adjust your profile picture and specifically scout/attack certain people too. 

Your profile is saved to a personal MongoDB, and if you play on different servers, your profile persists between them.
